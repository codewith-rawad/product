# Centered Container Layout with Styled Flexbox Elements

This project demonstrates a centered container layout using HTML and CSS, featuring two main sections styled with flexbox properties for responsive positioning. Each section includes various styling elements such as background colors, font customization, and embedded images.

## Features

- **Responsive Centered Layout**: The `.container` is centered both vertically and horizontally using flexbox, filling 70% of the viewport height for a balanced look.
- **Two Main Sections**:
  - `.one`: Occupies 35% of the container width and is intended as a side panel.
  - `.two`: Occupies 65% of the container width, featuring a header, text elements, and a set of interactive items.
- **Flexbox Design**: The design uses flex properties for alignment, wrapping, and spacing between elements within the container.
- **Background Images**: The `.item` elements are small squares that display different background images to provide a visually appealing, interactive group.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides structure, including section divisions and text elements.
- **CSS**: Controls styling, layout, and hover interactions.
- **CSS Flexbox**: For centering, alignment, and layout flexibility within the container.

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over `.item` elements to observe any interactive behaviors.
2. **View on Different Screen Sizes**: The layout is responsive to screen changes, adjusting the flex properties accordingly.
